\Chapter{5}{\tCONGEST{}~Model: Bandwidth~Limitations}

\noindent
In the previous chapter, we learned about the $\LOCAL$ model. We saw that with the help of unique identifiers, it is possible to gather the full information on a connected input graph in $O(\diam(G))$ rounds. To achieve this, we heavily abused the fact that we can send arbitrarily large messages. In this chapter we will see what can be done if we are only allowed to send small messages. With this restriction, we arrive at a model that is commonly known as the ``$\CONGEST$ model''.


\section{Definitions}\label{sec:congest}

Let $A$ be a distributed algorithm that solves a problem $\Pi$ on a graph family $\calF$ in the $\LOCAL$ model. Assume that $\Msg_A$ is a countable set; without loss of generality, we can then assume that
\[
    \Msg_A = \NN,
\]
that is, the messages are encoded as natural numbers. Now we say that $A$ solves problem $\Pi$ on graph family $\calF$ in the $\CONGEST$ model if the following holds for some constant $C$: for any graph $G = (V,E) \in \calF$, algorithm $A$ only sends messages from the set $\{0, 1, \dotsc, |V|^C\}$.

Put otherwise, we have the following \emph{bandwidth restriction}: in each communication round, over each edge, we only send $O(\log n)$-bit messages, where $n$ is the total number of nodes.


\section{Examples}

Assume that we have an algorithm $A$ that is designed for the $\LOCAL$ model. Moreover, assume that during the execution of $A$ on a graph $G = (V,E)$, in each communication round, we only need to send the following pieces of information over each edge:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item $O(1)$ node identifiers,
    \item $O(1)$ edges, encoded as a pair of node identifiers,
    \item $O(1)$ counters that take values from $0$ to $\diam(G)$,
    \item $O(1)$ counters that take values from $0$ to $|V|$,
    \item $O(1)$ counters that take values from $0$ to $|E|$.
\end{itemize}
Now it is easy to see that we can encode all of this as a binary string with $O(\log n)$ bits. Hence $A$ is not just an algorithm for the $\LOCAL$ model, but it is also an algorithm for the $\CONGEST$ model.

Many algorithms that we have encountered in this book so far are of the above form, and hence they are also $\CONGEST$ algorithms (see Exercise~\ref{ex:congest-prior}). However, there is a notable exception: the algorithm for gathering the entire network Section~\longref{4.2}{sec:gather}. In this algorithm, we need to send messages of size up to $\Theta(n^2)$ bits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To encode the set of nodes, we may need up to $\Theta(n \log n)$ bits (a list of $n$ identifiers, each of which is $\Theta(\log n)$ bits long).
    \item To encode the set of edges, we may need up to $\Theta(n^2)$ bits (the adjacency matrix).
\end{itemize}

While algorithms with a running time of $O(\diam(G))$ or $O(n)$ are trivial in the $\LOCAL$ model, this is no longer the case in the $\CONGEST$ model. Indeed, there are graph problems that \emph{cannot} be solved in time $O(n)$ in the $\CONGEST$ model (see Exercise~\ref{ex:congest-gather-lb}).

In this chapter, we will learn techniques that can be used to design efficient algorithms in the $\CONGEST$ model. We will use the all-pairs shortest path problem as the running example.


\section{All-Pairs Shortest Path Problem}

Throughout this chapter, we will assume that the input graph $G = (V,E)$ is connected, and as usual, we have $n = |V|$. In the \emph{all-pairs shortest path} problem (APSP in brief), the goal is to find the distances between all pairs of nodes. More precisely, the local output of node $v \in V$ is
\[
    f(v) = \bigl\{ (u, d) : u \in V,\ d = \dist_G(v, u) \bigr\}.
\]
That is, $v$ has to know the identities of all other nodes, as well as the shortest-path distance between itself and all other nodes.

Note that to represent the local output of a single node we need $\Theta(n \log n)$ bits, and just to transmit this information over a single edge we would need $\Theta(n)$ communication rounds. Indeed, we can prove that any algorithm that solves the APSP problem in the $\CONGEST$ model takes $\Omega(n)$ rounds\mydash see Exercise~\ref{ex:apsp-lb}.

In this chapter, we will present an optimal distributed algorithm for the APSP problem: it solves the problem in $O(n)$ rounds in the $\CONGEST$ model.

\section{Single-Source Shortest Paths}\label{sec:wave}

As a warm-up, we will start with a much simpler problem. Assume that we have elected a leader $s \in V$, that is, there is precisely one node $s$ with input $1$ and all other nodes have input $0$. We will design an algorithm such that each node $v \in V$ outputs
\[
    f(v) = \dist_G(s,v),
\]
i.e., its shortest-path distance to leader $s$.

The algorithm proceeds as follows. In the first round, the leader will send message \msg{wave} to all neighbors, switch to state $0$, and stop. In round $i$, each node $v$ proceeds as follows: if $v$ has not stopped, and if it receives message \msg{wave} from some ports, it will send message \msg{wave} to all other ports, switch to state $i$, and stop; otherwise it does nothing. See Figure~\ref{fig:wave}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[page=\PWave]{figs.pdf}
    \caption{(a)~Graph $G$ and leader~$s$. (b)~Execution of algorithm $\Wave$ on graph $G$. The arrows denote \msg{wave} messages, and the dotted lines indicate the communication round during which these messages were sent.}\label{fig:wave}
\end{figure}

The analysis of the algorithm is simple. By induction, all nodes at distance $i$ from $s$ will receive message \msg{wave} from at least one port in round $i$, and they will hence output the correct value~$i$. The running time of the algorithm is $O(\diam(G))$ rounds in the $\CONGEST$ model.


\section{Breadth-First Search Tree}\label{sec:bfs}

Algorithm $\Wave$ finds the shortest-path distances from a single source $s$. Now we will do something slightly more demanding: calculate not just the distances but also the shortest paths.

More precisely, our goal is to construct a \emph{breadth-first search tree} (BFS tree) $T$ rooted at $s$. This is a spanning subgraph $T = (V,E')$ of $G$ such that $T$ is a tree, and for each node $v \in V$, the shortest path from $s$ to $v$ in tree $T$ is also a shortest path from $s$ to $v$ in graph $G$. We will also label each node $v \in V$ with a \emph{distance label} $d(v)$, so that for each node $v \in V$ we have
\[
    d(v) = \dist_T(s,v) = \dist_G(s,v).
\]
See Figure~\ref{fig:bfs} for an illustration. We will interpret $T$ as a directed graph, so that each edge is of form $(u,v)$, where $d(u) > d(v)$, that is, the edges point towards the root~$s$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[page=\PBFS]{figs.pdf}
    \caption{(a)~Graph $G$ and leader~$s$. (b)~BFS tree $T$ (arrows) and distance labels $d(v)$ (numbers).}\label{fig:bfs}
\end{figure}

There is a simple centralized algorithm that constructs the BFS tree and distance labels: breadth-first search. We start with an empty tree and unlabeled nodes. First we label the leader $s$ with $d(s) = 0$. Then in step $i = 0, 1, \dotsc$, we visit each node $u$ with distance label $d(u) = i$, and check each neighbor $v$ of $u$. If we have not labeled $v$ yet, we will label it with $d(v) = i+1$, and add the edge $(v,u)$ to the BFS tree. This way all nodes that are at distance $i$ from $s$ in $G$ will be labeled with the distance label $i$, and they will also be at distance $i$ from $s$ in~$T$.

We can implement the same idea as a distributed algorithm in the CONGEST model. We will call this algorithm $\BFS$. In the algorithm, each node $v$ maintains the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d(v)$: distance to the root.
    \item $p(v)$: pointer to the parent of node $v$ in tree $T$ (port number).
    \item $C(v)$: the set of children of node $v$ in tree $T$ (port numbers).
    \item $a(v)$: acknowledgment\mydash set to $1$ when the subtree rooted at $v$ has been constructed.
\end{itemize}
Here $a(v) = 1$ denotes a stopping state. When the algorithm stops, variables $d(v)$ will be distance labels, tree $T$ is encoded in variables $p(v)$ and $C(v)$, and all nodes will have $a(v) = 1$.

Initially, we set $d(v) \gets \bot$, $p(v) \gets \bot$, $C(v) \gets \bot$, and $a(v) \gets 0$ for each node $v$, except for the root which has $d(s) = 0$. We will grow tree $T$ from $s$ by iterating the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each node $v$ with $d(v) \ne \bot$ and $C(v) = \bot$ will send a \emph{proposal} with value $d(v)$ to all neighbors.
    \item If a node $u$ with $d(u) = \bot$ receives some proposals with value $j$, it will \emph{accept} one of them and \emph{reject} all other proposals. It will set $p(u)$ to point to the node whose proposal it accepted, and it will set $d(u) \gets j+1$.
    \item Each node $v$ that sent some proposals will set $C(v)$ to be the set of neighbors that accepted proposals.
\end{itemize}
This way $T$ will grow towards the leaf nodes. Once we reach a leaf node, we will send acknowledgments back towards the root:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each node $v$ with $a(v) = 1$ and $p(v) \ne \bot$ will send an \emph{acknowledgment} to port $p(v)$.
    \item Each node $v$ with $a(v) = 0$ and $C(v) \ne \bot$ will set $a(v) \gets 1$ when it has received acknowledgments from each port of $C(v)$. In particular, if a node has $C(v) = \emptyset$, it can set $a(v) \gets 1$ without waiting for any acknowledgments.
\end{itemize}
It is straightforward to verify that the algorithm works correctly and constructs a BFS tree in $O(\diam(G))$ rounds in the $\CONGEST$ model.

Note that the acknowledgments would not be strictly necessary in order to construct the tree. However, they will be very helpful in the next section when we use algorithm $\BFS$ as a subroutine.


\section{Leader Election}\label{sec:leader}

Algorithm $\BFS$ constructs a BFS tree rooted at a single leader, assuming that we have already elected a leader. Now we will show how to elect a leader. Surprisingly, we can use algorithm $\BFS$ to do it!

We will design an algorithm $\algo{Leader}$ that finds the node with the smallest identifier; this node will be the leader. The basic idea is very simple:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We modify algorithm $\BFS$ so that we can run multiple copies of it in parallel, with different root nodes. We augment the messages with the identity of the root node, and each node keeps track of the variables $d$, $p$, $C$, and $a$ separately for each possible root.
    \item Then we pretend that all nodes are leaders and start running $\BFS$. In essence, we will run $n$ copies of $\BFS$ in parallel, and hence we will construct $n$ BFS trees, one rooted at each node. We will denote by $\BFS_v$ the $\BFS$ process rooted at node $v \in V$, and we will write $T_v$ for the output of this process.
\end{enumerate}
However, there are two problems: First, it is not yet obvious how all this would help with leader election. Second, we cannot implement this idea directly in the $\CONGEST$ model\mydash nodes would need to send up to $n$ distinct messages per communication round, one per each $\BFS$ process, and there is not enough bandwidth for all those messages.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[page=\PLeader]{figs.pdf}
    \caption{Leader election. Each node $v$ will launch a process $\BFS_v$ that attempts to construct a BFS tree $T_v$ rooted at $v$. Other nodes will happily follow $\BFS_v$ if $v$ is the smallest leader they have seen so far; otherwise they will start to ignore messages related to $\BFS_v$. Eventually, precisely one of the processes will complete successfully, while all other process will get stuck at some point. In this example, node $1$ will be the leader, as it has the smallest identifier. Process $\BFS_2$ will never succeed, as node $1$ (as well as all other nodes that are aware of node $1$) will ignore all messages related to $\BFS_2$. Node $1$ is the only root that will receive acknowledgments from every child.}\label{fig:leader}
\end{figure}

Fortunately, we can solve both of these issues very easily; see Figure~\ref{fig:leader}:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Each node will only send messages related to the tree that has the \emph{smallest identifier as the root}. More precisely, for each node $v$, let $U(v) \subseteq V$ denote the set of nodes $u$ such that $v$ has received messages related to process $\BFS_u$, and let $\ell(v) = \min U(v)$ be the smallest of these nodes. Then $v$ will ignore messages related to process $\BFS_u$ for all $u \ne \ell(v)$, and it will only send messages related to process $\BFS_{\ell(v)}$.
\end{enumerate}
We make the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In each round, each node will only send messages related to at most one $\BFS$ process. Hence we have solved the second problem\mydash this algorithm can be implemented in the $\CONGEST$ model.
    \item Let $s = \min V$ be the node with the smallest identifier. When messages related to $\BFS_s$ reach a node $v$, it will set $\ell(v) = s$ and never change it again. Hence all nodes will follow process $\BFS_s$ from start to end, and thanks to the acknowledgments, node $s$ will eventually know that we have successfully constructed a BFS tree $T_s$ rooted at it.
    \item Let $u \ne \min V$ be any other node. Now there is at least one node, $s$, that will ignore all messages related to process $\BFS_u$. Hence $\BFS_u$ will never finish; node $u$ will never receive the acknowledgments related to tree $T_u$ from all neighbors.
\end{itemize}
That is, we now have an algorithm with the following properties: after $O(\diam(G))$ rounds, there is precisely one node $s$ that knows that it is the unique node $s = \min V$. To finish the leader election process, node $s$ will inform all other nodes that leader election is over; node $s$ will output $1$ and all other nodes will output $0$ and stop.


\section{All-Pairs Shortest Paths}\label{sec:apsp}

Now we are ready to design algorithm $\algo{APSP}$ that solves the all-pairs shortest path problem (APSP) in time $O(n)$.

We already know how to find the shortest-path distances from a single source; this is efficiently solved with algorithm $\Wave$. Just like we did with the $\BFS$ algorithm, we can also augment $\Wave$ with the root identifier and hence have a separate process $\Wave_v$ for each possible root $v \in V$. If we could somehow run all these processes in parallel, then each node would receive a wave from every other node, and hence each node would learn the distance to every other node, which is precisely what we need to do in the APSP problem. However, it is not obvious how to achieve a good performance in the $\CONGEST$ model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If we try to run all $\Wave_v$ processes simultaneously in parallel, we may need to send messages related to several waves simultaneously over a single edge, and there is not enough bandwidth to do that.
    \item If we try to run all $\Wave_v$ processes sequentially, it will take a lot of time: the running time would be $O(n \diam(G))$ instead of $O(n)$.
\end{itemize}
The solution is to \emph{pipeline} the $\Wave_v$ processes so that we can have many of them running simultaneously in parallel, without congestion. In essence, we want to have multiple wavefronts active simultaneously so that they never collide with each other.

To achieve this, we start with the leader election and the construction of a BFS tree rooted at the leader; let $s$ be the leader, and let $T_s$ be the BFS tree. Then we do a \emph{depth-first traversal} of $T_s$. This is a walk $w_s$ in $T_s$ that starts at $s$, ends at $s$, and traverses each edge precisely twice; see Figure~\ref{fig:dfs}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[page=\PDFS]{figs.pdf}
    \caption{(a)~BFS tree $T_s$ rooted at $s$. (b)~A depth-first traversal $w_s$ of $T_s$.}\label{fig:dfs}
\end{figure}

More concretely, we move a \emph{token} along walk $w_s$. We move the token \emph{slowly}: we always spend 2 communication rounds before we move the token to an adjacent node. Whenever the token reaches a new node $v$ that we have not encountered previously during the walk, we launch process $\Wave_v$. This is sufficient to avoid all congestion!

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[page=\PPipeline]{figs.pdf}
    \caption{Algorithm $\algo{APSP}$: the token walks along the BFS tree at speed $0.5$ (thick arrows), while each $\Wave_v$ moves along the original graph at speed $1$ (dashed lines). The waves are strictly nested: if $\Wave_v$ was triggered after $\Wave_u$, it will never catch up with $\Wave_u$.}\label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure}

The key observation here is that the token moves slower than the waves. The waves move at speed $1$ edge per round (along the edges of $G$), while the token moves at speed $0.5$ edges per round (along the edges of $T_s$, which is a subgraph of $G$). This guarantees that two waves never collide. To see this, consider two waves $\Wave_u$ and $\Wave_v$, so that $\Wave_u$ was launched before $\Wave_v$. Let $d = \dist_G(u,v)$. Then it will take at least $2d$ rounds to move the token from $u$ to $v$, but only $d$ rounds for $\Wave_u$ to reach node $v$. Hence $\Wave_u$ was already past $v$ before we triggered $\Wave_v$, and $\Wave_v$ will never catch up with $\Wave_u$ as both of them travel at the same speed. See Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline} for an illustration.

Hence we have an algorithm $\algo{APSP}$ that is able to trigger all $\Wave_v$ processes in $O(n)$ time, without collisions, and each of them completes $O(\diam(G))$ rounds after it was launched. Overall, it takes $O(n)$ rounds for all nodes to learn distances to all other nodes. Finally, the leader can inform everyone else when it is safe to stop and announce the local outputs (e.g., with the help of another wave).


\section{Quiz}

Give an example of a graph problem that \emph{can} be solved in $O(1)$ rounds in the $\LOCAL$ model and \emph{cannot} be solved in $O(n)$ rounds in the $\CONGEST$ model. The input has to be an unlabeled graph; that is, the nodes will not have any inputs (beyond their own degree and their unique identifier). The output can be anything; you are free to construct an artificial graph problem. It is enough to give a brief definition of the graph problem; no further explanations are needed.


\section{Exercises}

\begin{ex}[prior algorithms]\label{ex:congest-prior}
    In Chapters \chapterref{3} and \chapterref{4} we have seen examples of algorithms that were designed for the $\PN$ and $\LOCAL$ models. Many of these algorithms use only small messages\mydash they can be used directly in the $\CONGEST$ model. Give at least four concrete examples of such algorithms, and prove that they indeed use only small messages.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[edge counting]
    The \emph{edge counting} problem is defined as follows: each node has to output the value $|E|$, i.e., it has to indicate how many edges there are in the graph.

        \item Otherwise all nodes output $0$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{ex}

    \hint{To reach a contradiction, assume that $A$ is an algorithm that solves the problem. For each $n$, let $\calF(n)$ consists of all graphs with the following properties: there are $n$ nodes with unique identifiers $1,2,\dotsc,n$, the graph is connected, and the degree of node $1$ is $1$. Then compare the following two quantities as a function of~$n$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f(n) = {}$how many different graphs there are in family $\calF(n)$.
        \item $g(n) = {}$how many different message sequences node number $1$ may receive during the execution of algorithm~$A$ if we run it on any graph $G \in \calF(n)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Argue that for a sufficiently large $n$, we will have $f(n) > g(n)$. Then there are at least two different graphs $G_1, G_2 \in \calF(n)$ such that node $1$ receives the same information when we run $A$ on either of these graphs.}

\section{Bibliographic Notes}

The name $\CONGEST$ is from Peleg's~\cite{peleg00distributed} book. Algorithm $\algo{APSP}$ is due to Holzer and Wattenhofer \cite{holzer12apsp}\mydash surprisingly, it was published only as recently as in 2012.
