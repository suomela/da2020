This book is an introduction to the theory of distributed algorithms, with focus on distributed graph algorithms (network algorithms). The topics covered include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Models of computing:} precisely what is a distributed algorithm, and what do we mean when we say that a distributed algorithm solves a certain computational problem?
    \item \textbf{Algorithm design and analysis:} which computational problems can be solved with distributed algorithms, which problems can be solved \emph{efficiently}, and how to do it?
    \item \textbf{Computability and computational complexity:} which computational problems \emph{cannot} be solved at all with distributed algorithms, which problems cannot be solved \emph{efficiently}, why is this the case, and how to prove it?
\end{itemize}
No prior knowledge of distributed systems is needed. A basic knowledge of discrete mathematics and graph theory is assumed, as well as familiarity with the basic concepts from undergraduate-level courses on models on computation, computational complexity, and algorithms and data structures.


\usection{About the Course}

This textbook was written to support the lecture course \emph{CS-E4510 Distributed Algorithms} at Aalto University. The course is worth 5 ECTS credits. There are 12 weeks of lectures. Each week we will cover one chapter of this book, and our students are expected to solve the quiz and at least 3 of the exercises from the chapter.
